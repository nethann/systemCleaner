Skip files modified within last 24 hours (optional setting).

Skip files currently in use (catch permission errors and log instead of deleting).

Only delete contents of folders, not the folder itself (safer).

Provide a “dry run” mode that only logs what it would delete (highly recommended for first few runs).
